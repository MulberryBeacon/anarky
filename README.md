# FLAC Manager

A set of simple Python programs that allow a user to manage the conversion
between several types of audio files.

## **wav2flac**

Encodes WAV files into the FLAC format with the maximum compression level.

### Instructions

The script can be invoked by using the following syntax:

	wav2flac [OPTION] [input-files] [-d] [destination]

The available options are:

* -f => Specify a set of files to convert
* -F => Folder with a set of files to convert
* -d => Folder in which the generated MP3 files will be saved
* -h => Display a help message with detailed information regarding the script
* -v => Output the current version

### Examples

A specific WAV file is selected and the resulting FLAC file will be stored in
the given folder.

	wav2flac -f lovely_song.wav -d ~/new_songs/

A folder with a set of WAV files is selected and the resulting FLAC files will
be stored in the given folder.

	wav2flac -F ~/songs/ -d ~/new_songs/

with Python built-in functions

Version 0.1.0

* Initial version

## Roadmap

Version 0.2.0 will have the following features:

* `flac2wav` will save any metadata present in ID3 tags to a text file and the
