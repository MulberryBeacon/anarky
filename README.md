# FLAC Manager

A set of simple Python programs that allow a user to manage the conversion
between several types of audio files.

## Programs

* `wav2flac` (lossless => lossless)  
Encodes WAV files into the FLAC format with the maximum compression level.
* `wav2mp3` (lossless => lossy)  
Encodes WAV files into the MP3 format with the maximum compression level.
* `flac2wav` (lossless => lossless)  
Decodes FLAC files into the WAV format.
* `flac2mp3` (lossless => lossy)  
Encodes FLAC files into the MP3 format with the maximum compression level.

## Instructions

Each of the programs provides the same set of options:

* -f => Specify a set of files to convert
* -F => Folder with a set of files to convert
* -d => Folder in which the generated MP3 files will be saved
* -h => Display a help message with detailed information regarding the script
* -v => Output the current version

The current syntax requires that both the location of the input and output files
be defined explicitly:

	[program] [-fF] [input-file(s)] [-d] [destination]

## Examples

A specific WAV file is selected and the resulting FLAC file will be stored in
the given folder.

	wav2flac -f lovely_song.wav -d ~/new_songs/

A folder with a set of WAV files is selected and the resulting MP3 files will
be stored in the given folder.

	wav2mp3 -F ~/songs/ -d ~/new_songs/

## Versions

Version 0.0.2

* First stable iteration
* Added the "-h", "-v", "-d", "-f" and "-F" options
* Refactored major portions of the code, mostly by replacing "hand made" code
with Python built-in functions

Version 0.0.1

* Initial version

## Bugs

* `flac2mp3` doesn't remove the temporary WAV files extracted from the input
FLAC files. The code for this is already implemented (albeit pending a review),
but it needs to be invoked

* `flac2wav` and `flac2mp3` don't remove the temporary cover file extracted from
the input FLAC files. Code still needs to be implement to perform this step

## Roadmap

Version 0.0.3 will have the following features:

* With the exception of `flac2wav`, each program will have an additional option
that, when triggered, will enable the creation of a playlist file (.m3u)
* `flac2wav` will save any metadata present in ID3 tags to a text file and the
album cover to an image file while decoding the given FLAC files
* `wav2flac` will have two additional command line arguments to import a text
file with ID3 tags and an image file with an album cover

Version 0.0.4 will have the following features:

* A new master control program (nudge nudge, wink wink) that could be used
instead of the individual programs. It will have two additional options for
the desired input and output formats, while keep the set of options outlined
for the current set of programs
