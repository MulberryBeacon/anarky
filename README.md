FlacToMp3
=========

A simple Python script that takes a list of FLAC files and performs the
following operations for each file:

* Decodes the FLAC file and saves (if any) the metadata present in ID3 tags;
* Converts the resulting WAV file to MP3, using the maximum compression level
and the metadata retrieved in the previous step;
* Encodes the FLAC file with the maximum compression level;
* Removes the previously extracted WAV files.

Instructions
------------

The script can be invoked by using the following syntax:

	flactomp3 [-f] [filenames] [-d] [folder]

The available options are:

* -f => Specify a set of files to convert
* -F => Folder with a set of files to convert
* -d => Folder in which the generated MP3 files will be saved
* -h => Display a help message with detailed information regarding the script
* -v => Output the current version

Examples
--------

A specific FLAC file is selected and the resulting MP3 file will be stored in
the current folder (where the script is run).

	flactomp3 -f lovely_song.flac

A specific FLAC file is selected and the resulting MP3 file will be stored in
the given folder.

	flactomp3 -f lovely_song.flac -d ~/new_songs/

A folder with a set of FLAC files is selected and the resulting MP3 files will
be stored in the given folder.

	flactomp3 -F ~/songs/ -d ~/new_songs/

A specific FLAC file and a folder with a set of FLAC files are selected, with
the resulting MP3 files being stored in the given folder.

	flactomp3 -f lovely_song.flac -F ~/lovely_songs/ -d ~/new_songs/

Versions
--------

Version 0.1.1

* First stable iteration
* Added the "-h", "-v", "-d", "-f" and "-F" options
* Refactored major portions of the code, mostly by replacing "hand made" code
with Python built-in functions

Version 0.1.0

* Initial version

Roadmap
-------

Version 0.1.1 will have the following features:

* Broaden the range of command line options:
	* If no file names are given, the program will go through the contents of
	the current folder and convert any FLAC files it finds;

Version 0.1.2 will have the following features:

* New round of deep testing, bug fixing and code normalization;
* Add the album cover to the set of metadata copied from FLAC to MP3 files;
* Global file checking and exception handling.
