FlacToMp3
=========

A simple Python script that takes a list of FLAC files and performs the
following operations for each file:
* Decodes the FLAC file and saves (if any) the metadata present in ID3 tags;
* Converts the resulting WAV file to MP3, using the maximum compression level
and the metadata retrieved in the previous step;
* Encodes the FLAC file with the maximum compression level;
* Removes the previously extracted WAV files.

Versions
--------

* version 0.1.1
	* First stable iteration
	* Added the "-h", "-v", "-d", "-f" and "-F" options
	* Refactored major portions of the code, mostly by replacing "hand made"
	code by Python built-in functions

* version 0.1.0
	* Initial version

Roadmap
-------

Version 0.1.1 will have the following features:
* Ability to save the generated MP3 files in a new folder. The user will be
able to define the path to the MP3 folder as a command line argument (-d flag).
* Broaden the range of command line options:
	* Currently, the user can only pass one file name as an argument (if no file
	is given or the argument is not a file, the program crashes);
	* Allow for one or more file names as arguments (-f flag);
	* If no file names are given, the program will go through the contents of
	the current folder and convert any FLAC files it finds;
* Global file checking and exception handling.

Version 0.1.2 will have the following features:
* New round of deep testing, bug fixing and code normalization;
* Add the album cover to the set of metadata copied from FLAC to MP3 files;
* Global file checking and exception handling.
